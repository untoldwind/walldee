WallDee: Simple backend for wall displays
=========================================

# Installation

WallDee is a Play 2.0 application. To run it you first have to download the latest release from

http://www.playframework.org

(Use 2.0.4 or later, in near future Play 2.1 will do as well)

Next you just have to clone the repository somewhere and start it like any other Play application:

```
$ git https://github.com/untoldwind/walldee.git
$ cd walldee
$ <path to your play installation>/play start
```

By default the server will start on port 9000, refer to the Play documentation how to change that is necessary.
